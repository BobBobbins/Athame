			<p>Athame is a program for downloading music from streaming services like Tidal and Google Play Music. It is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/svbnet/Athame">open-source</a> and free for personal use.
			It is currently in alpha and requires Microsoft Windows and .NET (though it does kind of work on Linux with Mono).</p>

			<h2>Download</h2>
			<p>Tested to work on Windows 7, and requires <a target="_blank" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=780601">.NET framework 4.6.2</a> or later.</p>
			<p>Also works somewhat on Linux/OS X with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/">Mono</a>, but quite buggy and expected to break with later releases.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Athame is alpha software, which means it could break at any time.</li>
				<li>You must not share or redistribute any content downloaded with Athame.</li>
				<li>Athame attempts to replicate the function of the "offline download" feature many music streaming apps have. Therefore, when your music streaming service subscription ends, you are obliged to delete any content you have downloaded to your computer or device.</li>
				<li>Athame uses internal APIs, which means they are subject to change at the discretion of the streaming service provider.</li>
